# Genius RISC-V FPGA Project

Repository hosting the development of a set of synthesizable hardware and accompanying RISC-V Assembly software for implementing the **Genius** game (Estrela Toys, early 1980s), using **SystemVerilog** and **RISC-V Assembly**. The project follows the **Problem-Based Learning (PBL)** methodology outlined in *PBLs Treinamento.pdf*.

## üß† About the Genius Game

**Genius** is an iconic memory-based electronic game first released in Brazil by **Estrela** in the early 1980s. The gameplay revolves around repeating increasingly complex sequences of colored lights and corresponding tones, testing the player‚Äôs memory and attention.

</p>

### Game Mechanics:

- The device lights up a sequence using four colored buttons (typically red, green, blue, and yellow), each with a unique tone.
- The player must repeat the sequence correctly. If successful, the device adds one more step to the sequence.
- The game continues until the player makes a mistake, or completes the maximum sequence length based on the chosen difficulty.

This project recreates those mechanics using digital logic design and embedded programming, enabling new generations to experience the challenge of Genius on FPGA platforms.

## üìã Overview

- **Goal:** Design and validate an embedded prototype of the Genius game, exploring hardware/software co-design.  
- **Tools:**
  - **Hardware:** Vivado (synthesis, static timing analysis, FPGA prototyping)  
  - **Software:** QEMU for running RISC-V Assembly code  
- **Methodology:** Divided into 4 PBL modules, each addressing different abstraction levels and implementation techniques.

| **PBL01** | RTL implementation of the Genius game using a hard-coded FSM: SystemVerilog design, sequence control logic, and GPIO/LED interface.      |
| **PBL02** | Implementation of the game logic in **RISC-V Assembly**, running at machine-code level using the QEMU simulator.                         |
| **PBL03** | Design and functional verification (UVM) of a **simplified RISC-V processor** capable of executing the software developed in PBL02.      |
| **PBL04** | RTL synthesis, **Static Timing Analysis** (targeting 200 MHz), and FPGA prototyping of the verified hardware system.                     |

## üéÆ Game Features

- **3 Difficulty Levels:**
  - Easy: 8-step sequence  
  - Medium: 16-step sequence  
  - Hard: 32-step sequence  
- **2 Speeds:**
  - Slow: 2 s between signals  
  - Fast: 1 s  
- **2 Game Modes:**
  - **Follow:** Device generates and displays a sequence to be repeated.  
  - **Your Turn:** User inputs a sequence; device then repeats it and prompts for extension.  
- **Scoreboard** on a 7-segment BCD display, calculated according to selected difficulty and speed.  
- **Random sequences** generated by a stateless PRNG.
